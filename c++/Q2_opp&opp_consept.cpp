What is OOP? 
---------------
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

1.0OOP is faster and easier to execute
2.0OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
3.0OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
4.0OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

List OOP concepts :- 
----------------------------------------- 
                Before starting to learn C++ it is essential to have a basic knowledge of the concepts of Object
                oriented programming. Some of the important object oriented features are namely:
1.Objects
2.Classes
3.Inheritance
4.Data Abstraction
5.Data Encapsulation
6.Polymorphism
7.Overloading
8.Reusability
